                    <p>Hi there! I'm Drenz Gabriel V. Tabio, a 16-year-old from the lovely Villa Grande Subdivision in Cupang, Antipolo City.<br/>
                        I've always been fascinated by the art of photography, and you'll often find me exploring the world through the lens of my camera, capturing the beauty of everyday moments<br/>
                        When I'm not behind the camera, I'm likely immersed in the virtual world, enjoying my passion for gaming, or crafting lines of code to bring my ideas to life in the digital realm.<br/>
                        My educational journey led me to Marikina High School, where I graduated with an insatiable curiosity and an eagerness to continue learning and growing.<br/>
                        Life's an adventure, and I'm excited to embark on it, one snapshot, one game, and one line of code at a time. Let's connect, share experiences, and learn from each other on this exciting journey!
